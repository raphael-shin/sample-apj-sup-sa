"""AnalyticsAgentCoreProcessor — bridges Pipecat and the deployed Strands agent.

Differences from the stock AWSAgentCoreProcessor:
1. Injects gateway_token into every payload (via token_fn callable).
2. Properly buffers the SSE stream across HTTP chunk boundaries before splitting
   on newlines, preventing the partial-line warnings and dropped text.
3. Reads text from the Strands event path:
       data: {"event": {"contentBlockDelta": {"delta": {"text": "..."}}}}
   rather than the reference-agent shape {"response": "..."}.
